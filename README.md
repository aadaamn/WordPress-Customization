# WordPress-Customization

Hi, this is a personal project of mine whereas to enchance and add new functionalies to the WordPress and WooCommerce sites. For this project, I've managed to do several things such as

1. AJAX Load More Pagination with Filters for Shop and Category Pages
2. Adding Custom Fields to WooCommerce Registration Form
3. Integrate Contact Form 7 plugin with WooCommerce Registration
4. Dynamic Checkout Fields by Language with GTranslate Integration

For more details, can checkout the documentation PDF file I've attached in the repository. Thank you. Let me know if you have any improvements.
